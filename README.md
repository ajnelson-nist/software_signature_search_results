# Registry Signature Searcher results

This repository's purpose is to store rendered results of the Signature Searcher evaluation, outside of the code history of the evaluation.  The results tracked here were generated with the version of the evaluation code tracked in the submodule.

Please see the README of the evaluation submodule.  After running the submodule's README directions up through the Brown corpus download, `make` (with all desired parallelization with `-j $n`) can be run in the results module's directory.
